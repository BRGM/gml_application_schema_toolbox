GML application schema toolbox
==============================

This is prototype implementation of a toolbox designed to manipulate Complex Features.

It mainly consists of a QGIS plugin that allows to import Complex Features in two modes:

  * the native XML mode
  * the relational mode where the XML is first converted into a database, thanks to the PyXB library

The [gml_application_schema_toolbox](gml_application_schema_toolbox) contains the QGIS plugin sources.

The [samples](samples) directory contains sample Complex Features streams.

The [doc](doc) directory contains some documentation on the project.
